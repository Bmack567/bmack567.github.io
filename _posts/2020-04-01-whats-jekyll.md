Welcome to First-Year Writing! In this course, we will examine the textual and visual languages in which we write, the ideas they describe, and how our thinking is shaped by the process of rigorous study. We will also explore the interaction between words and images to understand how our writing process is informed by our visual literacy. We will be writing or drawing in every class and we will work on our papers together. 

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Lanyon.
